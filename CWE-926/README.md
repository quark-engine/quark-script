# Detect CWE-926 in Android Application (dvba.apk)

This scenario seeks to find **improper export of Android application components** in the APK file. See [CWE-926](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/926.html) for more details.

Letâ€™s use this [APK](https://github.com/rewanthtammana/Damn-Vulnerable-Bank) and the above APIs to show how Quark script find this vulnerability.

First, we use Quark API `getActivities` to get all activity data in the manifest. Then we use `activityInstance.hasIntentFilter` to check if the activities have `intent-filter`. Also, we use `activityInstance.isExported` to check if the activities set the attribute `android:exported=true`. If both are **true**, then the APK exports the component for use by other applications. That may cause CWE-926 vulnerabilities.
## Quark Script CWE-926.py
```python
from quark.script import *

SAMPLE_PATH = "dvba.apk"

for activityInstance in getActivities(SAMPLE_PATH):

    if activityInstance.hasIntentFilter() and activityInstance.isExported():
        print(f"CWE-926 is detected in the activity, {activityInstance}")
```
## Quark Script Result
```
$ python3 CWE-926.py

CWE-926 is found in the activity, com.app.damnvulnerablebank.CurrencyRates
CWE-926 is found in the activity, com.app.damnvulnerablebank.SplashScreen
```
